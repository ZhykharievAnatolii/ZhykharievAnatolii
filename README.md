Hi, Iâ€™m ZhykharievAnatolii 
Iâ€™m a Frontend developer 
Iâ€™m currently learning JavaScript.
I like the chosen field of activity and I have experience in continuous learning.
I study every day, and I am happy to learn something new.
I am a disciplined and neat person.
I happily spend time learning something new.
My previous work organizes me for continuous development, and I can quickly remember and use new knowledge in practice.
I have already finished a course about JavaScript, Node, React, HTML and CSS, and know the structure and how it works.
I have my projects, which you can familiarize yourself  on my GitHub page.
I continue to study English in courses too,
