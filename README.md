Hi, Iâ€™m @ZhykharievAnatolii 
Iâ€™m a Frontend developer 
Iâ€™m currently learning JavaScript.
I like the chosen field of activity and I have experience in continuous learning.
I study every day, and I am happy to learn something new.
I am a disciplined and neat person, I happily spend time learning something new.
My previous work from the very beginning organizes me for continuous development, and I am able to quickly remember and use new knowledge in practice.
I have already finished a course about JavaScript, Node, React, HTML and CSS, and have knowledge about the structure and how it works.
I have my projects, which you can familiarize yourself with on my GitHub page.
I continue to study English in courses too, 
currently, I have an intermediate level.
